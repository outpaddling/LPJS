Add lpjs cancel job|submission-#

Add #lpjs log-dir for chaperone-*, *.stderr, *.stdout

Add #lpjs concurrent-job-limit

systemctl restart lpjs_compd doesn't work
    Waiting a while and running restart again starts the daemon

Terminate jobs that exceed their resource allocation
    Only if there are jobs in the queue

Report peak resource use compared to specified

Doc:
    Any scripting language that treats "^#lpjs" as a comment
	Requests to support other comment formats will be considered
    Submission: All jobs under one "lpjs submit" command
    Job: An independent computational run
	Serial
	Multithreaded
	MPI
    Config file can be the same on all nodes, but the compute nodes
    only need the head node listed

Required submission parameters
    Jobs
    Processors per job
	Processor as defined by sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF)
	or getconf _NPROCESSORS_CONF
    Nodes per job
    pmem per job or pmem per core
    vmem per job or vmem per core
    
    Array: Jobs > 1
    Multithreaded: nodes per job = 1, cores per job = # or "all"
    MPI: Cores per job > 1

Optional submission parameters
    has_command, where command is any program in the standard PATH on node
	PATH may differ across compute nodes, as they may run different OSs

Add lpjs shell

Implement virtual memory limit checks
    Document that this is enforced by ulimit() and unbreakable

Implement real memory limit checks
    Document that this is enforced by periodic sampling

Convert sbatch scripts to lpjs and vice versa
    #lpjs <-> #SBATCH
    LPJS_ARRAY_INDEX <-> SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
